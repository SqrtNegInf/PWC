# If $d is 1 then it's always true.
# If $d is 2 then every $sum above 19 is true because it is either 20 +
# x * $d or 21 + x * $d.
# If $d is 3 then every $sum above 29 is true because it is either 30 +
# x * $d or 31 + x * $d or 22 + x * $d.
# So, by inspection if $d = 9 The biggest number which cannot be summed
# to is 80?
