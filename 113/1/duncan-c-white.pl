# Task 1: "Represent Integer
# 
# You are given a positive integer $N and a digit $D.
# 
# Write a script to check if $N can be represented as a sum of positive
# integers having $D at least once. If check passes print 1 otherwise 0.
# 
# Example
# 
# Input: $N = 25, $D = 7
# Output: 0 as there are 2 numbers between 1 and 25 having the digit 7
# i.e. 7 and 17. If we add up both we don't get 25.
# 
# Input: $N = 24, $D = 7
# Output: 1
# "
# 
# My notes: sounds very simple.  sum ( grep contains 7 )
#
