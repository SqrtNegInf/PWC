# For the challenge description, see ../README.md
#

#
# The challenge doesn't describe what a word is, or what to
# do with things which are neither words, nor whitespace, like
# punctuation.
#
# For instance, what should happen to the sentence:
#
#     "The Weekly Challenge, Part 1!"
#
# So, we're using the easy way out, and assume anything which isn't
# whitespace to be part of a word. After all, the examples assumen
# all the world is ASCII letters and spaces.
#
# Which makes the excercise too trivial to be called a challenge.
#

# Extract 'words', reverse the list, and print it.
say join " " => reverse /\S+/g for <DATA>;
