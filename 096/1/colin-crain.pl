#       TASK #1 › Reverse Words
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         
#             You are given a string $S.
# 
#             Write a script to reverse the order of words in the given string.
#             The string may contain leading/trailing spaces. The string may have
#             more than one space between words in the string. Print the result
#             without leading/trailing spaces and there should be only one space
#             between words.
# 
#             Example 1:            
#                 Input: $S = "The Weekly Challenge"
#                 Output: "Challenge Weekly The"
#  
#             Example 2:          
#                 Input: $S = "    Perl and   Raku are  part of the same family  "
#                 Output: "family same the of part are Raku and Perl"
