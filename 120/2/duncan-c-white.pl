# Task 2: "Clock Angle
# 
# You are given time $T in the format hh:mm.
# 
# Write a script to find the smaller angle formed by the hands of an analog
# clock at a given time.
# 
# HINT: A analog clock is divided up into 12 sectors. One sector represents
# 30 degree (360/12 = 30).
# 
# Example
# 
#   Input: $T = '03:10'
#   Output: 35 degree
# 
#   The distance between the 2 and the 3 on the clock is 30 degree.
#   For the 10 minutes i.e. 1/6 of an hour that have passed.
#   The hour hand has also moved 1/6 of the distance between the 3 and the 4,
#   which adds 5 degree (1/6 of 30).
#   The total measure of the angle is 35 degree.
# 
#   Input: $T = '04:00'
#   Output: 120 degree
# "
# 
# My notes: sounds pretty easy.
