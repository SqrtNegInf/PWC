=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<L<The Weekly Challenge, TASK #2 E<gt> Clock Angle|https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-120/#TASK2>>

I<Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar>

You are given time $T in the format hh:mm.

Write a script to find the smaller angle formed by the hands of an analog clock at a given time.
HINT: A analog clock is divided up into 12 sectors. One sector represents 30 degree (360/12 = 30).

=head2 Example

=over 4

Input: $T = '03:10'
Output: 35 degree

The distance between the 2 and the 3 on the clock is 30 degree.
For the 10 minutes i.e. 1/6 of an hour that have passed.
The hour hand has also moved 1/6 of the distance between the 3 and the 4, which adds 5 degree (1/6 of 30).
The total measure of the angle is 35 degree.

Input: $T = '04:00'
Output: 120 degree

=head1 INTERPRETATION

Problem statement and examples are straightforward.
