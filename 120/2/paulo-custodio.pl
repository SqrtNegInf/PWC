# Challenge 120
#
# TASK #2 › Clock Angle
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
# You are given time $T in the format hh:mm.
#
# Write a script to find the smaller angle formed by the hands of an analog
# clock at a given time.
#
# HINT: A analog clock is divided up into 12 sectors. One sector represents 30
# degree (360/12 = 30).
#
# Example
# Input: $T = '03:10'
# Output: 35 degree
#
# The distance between the 2 and the 3 on the clock is 30 degree.
# For the 10 minutes i.e. 1/6 of an hour that have passed.
# The hour hand has also moved 1/6 of the distance between the 3 and the 4,
# which adds 5 degree (1/6 of 30).
# The total measure of the angle is 35 degree.
#
# Input: $T = '04:00'
# Output: 120 degree
