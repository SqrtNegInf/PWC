# Task 1: "Swap Odd/Even bits
# 
# You are given a positive integer $N less than or equal to 255.
# 
# Write a script to swap the odd positioned bit with even positioned bit
# and print the decimal equivalent of the new binary representation.
# 
# Example
# 
#   Input: $N = 101
#   Output: 154
# 
#   Binary representation of the given number is 01 10 01 01.
#   The new binary representation after the odd/even swap is 10 01 10 10.
#   The decimal equivalent of 10011010 is 154.
# 
#   Input: $N = 18
#   Output: 33
# 
#   Binary representation of the given number is 00 01 00 10.
#   The new binary representation after the odd/even swap is 00 10 00 01.
#   The decimal equivalent of 100001 is 33.

# 
# My notes: trivial again.
