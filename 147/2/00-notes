Some tasks are painfully slow in Raku, so not tested.

Two were so bad in MoarVM that I killed them before they ever finished:
(just imagine how long they'd take with JVM)

polettix.raku
simon-proctor.raku

And just on the verge of being intolerable (in JVM):
arne-sommer.raku

Two others tooks hours in JVM, so were dropped:

jaldhar-h-vyas.raku
laurent-rosenfeld.raku
