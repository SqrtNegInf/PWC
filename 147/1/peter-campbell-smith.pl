# Write a script to generate first 20 left-truncatable prime numbers in base 10.
# In number theory, a left-truncatable prime is a prime number which, in a given base, 
# contains no 0, and if the leading left digit is successively removed, then all 
# resulting numbers are primes.

# Note that the last digit cannot be 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 0 as no primes end with those
# and cannot be 9 as when all the preceding digits are removed, 9 is not prime,
# so the last digit can only be 1, 3 or 7.

# The definition above speaks of 'all resulting numbers' so I am ruling out
# single-digit prime numbers as they have no 'resulting numbers' when the
# leftmost digit is removed.
