# Perl Weekly Challenge 081 Task #2 > Frequency Sort
#=============================================================================
# You are given file named input.
# Write a script to find the frequency of all the words.
# It should print the result as first column of each line should be the
# frequency of the the word followed by all the words of that frequency
# arranged in lexicographical order. Also sort the words in the ascending
# order of frequency.
# For the sake of this task, please ignore the following in the input file:
#   . " ( ) , 's --
# Keep hyphenated words and contractions, but reduce possessives to their base
# (e.g., "award-winning" and "doesn't" are words, but "Joe's" becomes "Joe"
