# West Side Story
# 
# The award-winning adaptation of the classic romantic tragedy "Romeo and
# Juliet". The feuding families become two warring New York City gangs,
# the white Jets led by Riff and the Latino Sharks, led by Bernardo. Their
# hatred escalates to a point where neither can coexist with any form
# of understanding. But when Riff's best friend (and former Jet) Tony
# and Bernardo's younger sister Maria meet at a dance, no one can do
# anything to stop their love. Maria and Tony begin meeting in secret,
# planning to run away. Then the Sharks and Jets plan a rumble under the
# highway--whoever wins gains control of the streets. Maria sends Tony
# to stop it, hoping it can end the violence. It goes terribly wrong,
# and before the lovers know what's happened, tragedy strikes and doesn't
# stop until the climactic and heartbreaking ending.
