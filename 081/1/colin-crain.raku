#         TASK #1 â€º Common Base String
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given 2 strings, $A and $B.
# 
#         Write a script to find out common base strings in $A and $B.
# 
#         A substring of a string $S is called base string if 
#         repeated concatenation of the substring results in the string.
# 
#         Example 1:
#         Input:
#             $A = "abcdabcd"
#             $B = "abcdabcdabcdabcd"
# 
#         Output:
#             ("abcd", "abcdabcd")
#         Example 2:
#         Input:
#             $A = "aaa"
#             $B = "aa"
# 
#         Output:
#             ("a")
# 
#         method:
#             This really isn't as complicated as it may sound.
# 
#             A common base string must by definition be sized as a harmonic
#             divisor of the original: 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 etc. We can save some
#             trouble by looking at only those substrings that fit this basic
#             constraint.
# 
#             Any base string will begin the source string and extend for n
#             characters, with n contained within the set of fractional
#             components outlined above with respect to the source string
#             length. Thus 1/2 length, or 1/3, 1/4 etc.
#             
#             It's also rather difficult to come up with a good example as most
#             input variations produce super-obvious results. Not much of a
#             needle in a haystack going on here.
