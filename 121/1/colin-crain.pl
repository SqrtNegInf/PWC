#       Invert Bit
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given integers 0 <= $m <= 255 and 1 <= $n <= 8.
# 
#         Write a script to invert $n bit from the end of the binary
#         representation of $m and print the decimal representation of the new
#         binary number.
# 
#         Example
#         Input: $m = 12, $n = 3
#         Output: 8
# 
#         Binary representation of $m = 00001100
#         Invert 3rd bit from the end = 00001000
#         Decimal equivalent of 00001000 = 8
# 
#         Input $m = 18, $n = 4
#         Output: 26
# 
#         Binary representation of $m = 00010010
#         Invert 4th bit from the end = 00011010
#         Decimal equivalent of 00011010 = 26
