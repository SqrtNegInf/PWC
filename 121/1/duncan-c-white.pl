# Task 1: "Invert Bit
# 
# You are given integers 0 <= $m <= 255 and 1 <= $n <= 8.
# 
# Write a script to invert $n bit from the end of the binary representation
# of $m and print the decimal representation of the new binary number.
# 
# Example
# 
#   Input: $m = 12, $n = 3
#   Output: 8
# 
# Binary representation of $m = 00001100
# Invert 3rd bit from the end = 00001000
# Decimal equivalent of 00001000 = 8
# 
#   Input $m = 18, $n = 4
#   Output: 26
# 
# Binary representation of $m = 00010010
# Invert 4th bit from the end = 00011010
# Decimal equivalent of 00011010 = 26
# "
# 
# My notes: trivial again.
