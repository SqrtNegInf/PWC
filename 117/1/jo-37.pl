### Input and Output

say join "\n", @{find_missing_rows(*ARGV{IO}, $rows)};


### Implementation

# The task is certainly over-determined:
# - There are 14 rows of data.
# - It's stated that rows are numbered 1 to 15.
# - It's stated that one row would be missing.
# Either the specification of the number of missing rows or the desired
# number of rows is superfluous.  Ignoring the number of missing rows
# here.
# Note: Ignoring both the number of rows *and* the number of missing
# rows prevents the determination of a missing last row.
sub find_missing_rows ($fh, $rows) {
    my %rows;
    @rows{1 .. $rows} = (1 .. $rows);
    # Row numbers shall be separated with a comma from the rest of the
    # row and may have leading zeros.
    delete @rows{do {local $/; <$fh> =~ /^0*(\d+)(?=,)/mg}};

    [sort {$a <=> $b} values %rows];
