# Task 1: "Count Numbers
# 
# You are given a positive integer $N.
# 
# Write a script to print count of numbers from 1 to $N that don't
# contain digit 1.
# 
# Example
# 
# Input: $N = 15
# Output: 8
# 
#     There are 8 numbers between 1 and 15 that don't contain digit 1.
#     2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
# 
# Input: $N = 25
# Output: 13
# 
#     There are 13 numbers between 1 and 25 that don't contain digit 1.
#     2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25.

# 
# My notes: very easy.  Let's produce the "There are ..." output if --debug
# is given, the terse output otherwise.
