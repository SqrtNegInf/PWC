# TASK #1 > Pythagorean Triples
# Submitted by: Cheok-Yin Fung
# You are given a positive integer $N.
#
# Write a script to print all Pythagorean Triples containing $N as a member.
# Print -1 if it can't be a member of any.
#
# Triples with the same set of elements are considered the same, i.e. if your
# script has already printed (3, 4, 5), (4, 3, 5) should not be printed.
#
# The famous Pythagorean theorem states that in a right angle triangle, the
# length of the two shorter sides and the length of the longest side are
# related by a2+b2 = c2.
#
# A Pythagorean triple refers to the triple of three integers whose lengths can
# compose a right-angled triangle.
#
# Example
#     Input: $N = 5
#     Output:
#         (3, 4, 5)
#         (5, 12, 13)
#
#     Input: $N = 13
#     Output:
#         (5, 12, 13)
#         (13, 84, 85)
#
#     Input: $N = 1
#     Output:
#         -1
