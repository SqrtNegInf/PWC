Tasks take a pretty long time with JVM:
    'mark-anderson.raku' - skip (hanging after the last test?)
    'arne-sommer.raku' - just inherently slow, so skip

'laurent-rosenfeld.raku' has a run-time error

Rarely, some Perl task in 125/1 varies. Not able to figure out which...
Keep  '00-perl.txt~' around to help with that.
