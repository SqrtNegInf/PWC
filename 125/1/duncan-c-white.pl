# Task 1: "Pythagorean Triples
# 
# You are given a positive integer $N.
# 
# Write a script to print all Pythagorean Triples containing $N as a
# member. Print -1 if it can't be a member of any. i
# 
# Triples with the same set of elements are considered the same, i.e. if
# your script has already printed (3, 4, 5), (4, 3, 5) should not be
# printed.
# 
# The famous Pythagorean theorem states that in a right angle triangle,
# the length of the two shorter sides and the length of the longest
# side are related by a2+b2 = c2.
# 
# A Pythagorean triple refers to the triple of three integers whose lengths
# can compose a right-angled triangle.
# 
# Example
# 
#     Input: $N = 5
#     Output:
#         (3, 4, 5)
#         (5, 12, 13)
# 
#     Input: $N = 13
#     Output:
#         (5, 12, 13)
#         (13, 84, 85)
# 
#     Input: $N = 1
#     Output:
#         -1
# "
# 
# My notes: the tricky part here is knowing how to generate all Pythagorean
# triples that MIGHT contain $N, i.e. when to stop generating triples..
# I think, when you've checked a + b, if int(sqrt(a*a+b*b))==b then stop
# considering bigger b values.
