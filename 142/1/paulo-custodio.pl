# TASK #1 > Divisor Last Digit
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
# You are given positive integers, $m and $n.
#
# Write a script to find total count of divisors of $m having last digit $n.
#
#
# Example 1:
# Input: $m = 24, $n = 2
# Output: 2
#
# The divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12.
# There are only 2 divisors having last digit 2 are 2 and 12.
#
# Example 2:
# Input: $m = 30, $n = 5
# Output: 2
#
# The divisors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10 and 15.
# There are only 2 divisors having last digit 5 are 5 and 15.
