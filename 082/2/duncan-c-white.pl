# Task 2: "Interleave String
# 
# You are given 3 strings; $A, $B and $C.
# 
# Write a script to check if $C is created by interleave $A and $B.
# 
# Print 1 if check is success otherwise 0.
#
# Example 1:
# 
# Input:
#     $A = "XY"
#     $B = "X"
#     $C = "XXY"
# 
# Output: 1
# 
# EXPLANATION
# 
# "X" (from $B) + "XY" (from $A) = $C
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input:
#     $A = "XXY"
#     $B = "XXZ"
#     $C = "XXXXZY"
# 
# Output: 1
# 
# EXPLANATION
# 
# "XX" (from $A) + "XXZ" (from $B) + "Y" (from $A) = $C
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# Input:
#     $A = "YX"
#     $B = "X"
#     $C = "XXY"
# 
# Output: 0
# 
# My notes: It's not quite clear what "interleaving" means here, but I'm
# going to assume that it means "take a PREFIX of any length from one string,
# followed by a PREFIX of any length from the other string, then continue
# with the parts of the strings not yet consumed".  Relatively easy.
