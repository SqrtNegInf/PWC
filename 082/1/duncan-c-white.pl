# Task 1: "Common Factors
#
# You are given 2 positive numbers $M and $N.
# 
# Write a script to list all common factors of the given numbers.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input:
#     $M = 12
#     $N = 18
# 
# Output:
#     (1, 2, 3, 6)
# 
# Explanation:
#     Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
#     Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input:
#     $M = 18
#     $N = 23
# 
# Output:
#     (1)
# 
# Explanation:
#     Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
#     Factors of 23: 1
# 
# My notes: simple, find factors and then intersect.
