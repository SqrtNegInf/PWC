# TASK #1 - Workdays
# 
# You are given a year, $year in 4-digits form.
# 
# Write a script to calculate the total number of workdays in the given year.
# For the task, we consider, Monday - Friday as workdays.
# 
# Example 1
# 
# 	Input: $year = 2021
# 	Output: 261
# 
# Example 2
# 
# 	Input: $year = 2020
# 	Output: 262
# 
# MY NOTES: Pretty easy.  Essentially: iterate over all days in $year, inc
# count if day_of_week(that day) is a week day (Mon..Fri).  Date::Simple
# looks like it can do everything we need.
#
