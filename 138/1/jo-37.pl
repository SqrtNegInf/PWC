### Input and Output

# Count workdays between Jan 1 of the given year and the next.
say workdays_int(DateTime->new(year => $ARGV[0]),
    DateTime->new(year => $ARGV[0] + 1));
    

### Implementation

# Find the number of workdays in the interval from $start to (not
# including) $end.  Expecting DateTime arguments.
sub workdays_int ($start, $end) {
    return 0 if $start >= $end;
    my $days = $end->delta_days($start)->in_units('days');
    # Sat is 5, Sun is 6.
    my $dow = $start->day_of_week_0;

    # Every full week has 5 workdays.  From the remaining days count
    # working days only.
    5 * int($days / 7) + grep abs($dow + $_ - 5.5) > 1, 0 .. $days % 7 - 1;
