# You are given a perfect square.
# Write a script to figure out if the square root of the given number is 
# same as the sum of 2 or more splits of the given number, eg sqrt(9801) = 98 + 0 + 1 = 99

# Discussion: The tricky requirement is to generate all the splits of a
# multi-digit number (eg 123456).  Consider the number as a string of n digits.
# Consider also a binary number with n - 1 digits (eg 01101).  If we generate
# all such binary numers, and consider each bit to represent whether the
# corresponding digit in the split is followed by ' + ', we can generate
# all the splits.  So for example 123456 and 01101 yields 12 + 3 + 45 + 6:
# a plus has been inserted after the first, second and fifth digits of n
# because the first, second and fifth bits of the binary number are 1.
#
# Once you have all the splits you can 'eval' them to get the sum, and compare
# it with sqrt(n).
#
# There is one slight catch. If n contains am embedded 0 (eg 123056) then
# you will get splits like 123 + 056.  Perl regards 056 as octal 56, so it
# is necessary to remove these leading zeroes before the eval.
