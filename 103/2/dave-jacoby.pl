    # 4:50pm - Restate my assumptions
    #   One:    Mathematics is the language of nature.
    #   Two:    Everything around us can be represented
    #           and understood through numbers.
    #   Three:  The streamer adds no time between recordings,
    #           nor crossfades between trackss, so there is no
    #           time unaccounted for between tracks
    #   Four:   The streamer will get to the end of the list and
    #           start all over again
    #   Five:   Pi is a movie that every developer of a certain age
    #           will recognize immediately
    #   Six:    Current time will be higher than start time, meaning
    #           we're not querying the past
    #   Seven:  The episodes in the CSV are roughly a half-hour each

    #   Hypothesis:
    #       We can subtract the start time from the time in
    #       question to find the total number of seconds that
    #       the streamer has played, then go through the whole
    #       playlist over and over until the current total is
    #       less than the run time, but the current total plus
    #       the next media file would be greater than the run
    #       time. This would indicate that this is the currently
    #       streaming file
