# Task 1: "Chinese Zodiac
# 
# You are given a year $year.
# 
# Write a script to determine the Chinese Zodiac for the given year
# $year. Please check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac
# for more information about it.
# 
# The animal cycle: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat,
# Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig.
# 
# The element cycle: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
#     Input: 2017
#     Output: Fire Rooster
# 
# Example 2:
# 
#     Input: 1938
#     Output: Earth Tiger
# "
# 
# My notes: ok, so seems to be a 12 year cycle of animal names, intertwined
# with a 10 year cycle of 5 elements, two successive years having the same
# element each time.
