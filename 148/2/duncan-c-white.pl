# TASK #2 - Cardano Triplets
# 
# Write a script to generate first N Cardano Triplets.
# 
# MY NOTES: This version (ch-2FAST.pl) uses a much more efficient parameterised
# version of Cardano Triplets that I found on the Internet but frankly don't
# understand how it was derived. See
#
# https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1885095/parametrization-of-cardano-triplet
#
# Specifically the author of that question claimed that the Cardano triplets
# formula may be expanded to:
#       8a**3+15a**2+6a - 27x=1
# where a=3k+2 and
#       x=(k+1)**2(8k+5)
#	(x represents b*b*c)
# 
# If this is correct, we can just loop directly through k calculating each
# (a, x), and selecting those for which the 8a**3... formula succeeds.
# Then we need to break x down into b and c - noting that several (b,c)
# pairs may result from a single value of x, so this doesn't generate
# Cardano triplets in anything like the same order as ch-2.pl does.
#
# Also, we may need bignum as the numbers get pretty big..
#
# In fact, I now realise that each (a,x) pair for every k automatically
# satisfies the 8a**3... formula so we don't even need to check it:
# this is now only checked if you specific --paranoid when running this.
#
# How much faster is this than ch-2.pl?  For n=40, ch-2.pl takes 30 seconds
# where this (ch-2FAST.pl) takes just under 2 seconds!  And this gets better
# as n increases: this version takes 6.9s for n=100, but I gave up on
# running ch-2.pl 40 after a couple of minutes when it had only found about
# 60 triples..  of course this version is faster, we are directly finding
# the (a,x) partial solutions and only have to break x down to one or more
# (b,c) pairs, whereas ch-2.pl is basically a brute force search.
