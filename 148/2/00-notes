There were different results for bruce-gray.raku:

JVM:
((  1   1   1) (  2   2   1) (  3   3   1) (  2   1   4) (  4   4   1))
((  1   1   1) (  2   1   4) (  2   2   1) (  3   1   9) (  3   3   1))

MoarVM:
((  2   1   5) (  5   2  13) ( 17  18   5) ( 17   9  20) (  8   3  21))
((  2   1   5) (  5   2  13) (  8   3  21) ( 17   9  20) ( 17  18   5))

Source of the problem was the 'â…“' character, in JVM 2021.11, still evaluates as zero, which throws off the calculations (no duh).
