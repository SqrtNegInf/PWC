#         method: 
# 
#             Somehow I feel confident some submissions from the team will copy
#             the above to a heredoc and print it out. I mean, it does fulfill
#             the requirement.
# 
#             But I am not that person.
# 
#             Why not? Well for I suppose the main reason is respect: I feel
#             that trivializing the task reflects poorly on the motivation
#             behind it, and trivializing International Women's Day, or any day
#             you want to call Women's Day for that matter, is just not
#             something I would ever want to do. I am and always have been a big
#             fan of women. I'm more than capable of trivializing worthless
#             ideas, don't get me wrong. But not this, no, not this. I'm going
#             to do this right, whatever that means.
# 
#             So what do we do? Well it's been quite a long time since I've done
#             any graphics programming, so how about that? Draw a circle and two
#             rectangles. Maybe out of X chromosones.
# 
#             To draw the circle we'll use Bresenham’s algorithm to draw the
#             best "pixels" in a "screen buffer", in this case a 2-dimensional
#             array. We can then write a rectangle tool and draw a vertical bar,
#             and another horizontal bar bisecting it. Because we're using a
#             buffer intermediate we can just write to the elements we need
#             filled in and not care about the canvas.
# 
#             About that: this is another place Perl's autovivifing arrays
#             really shine, because we don't need to precalculate the canvas
#             size. We can start drawing in and once the drawing is complete we
#             scan through the rows and transform undefined elements into
#             spaces, or whatever we define a space to be.
# 
#             The right edge will be invisibly ragged if we use spaces, so we
#             won't choose to do anything about it. As long as we use a
#             monospaced font, or at least two characters that match widths, all
#             the alignment will work out.
# 
#         Perl Notes:
# 
#             the implementation of Bresenham's algorithm I used chooses
#             the best single pixel to draw a 45° arc, flipped and mirrored
#             8 ways. After a little experimentation I decided the best
#             looking result to widen the line was to draw another circle
#             inside it, an another inside that. This led to the idea of a
#             standard width, to be followed in the rectangular blocks as
#             well. The standard length became the radius of the circle and
#             the lengths of the bars.
# 
#             I did fiddle the height of the vertical bar because good
#             design is good design. Round numbers are useless if it looks
#             bad. 
# 
#             The width, the font weight, became 1/5 the radius, or 1/10
#             the character width. That feels right; it's hard-coded but
#             easily configureed in one place. So the size of the Venus
#             drawing is specified by one parameter now, being half the
#             final width or 1/3.2 the height.
# 
#             SO... I added some noise, and mixed up the characters to give
#             it more drama. There's a chance now a set character will move
#             aboiut in a brownian manner, and if it moves it becomes a
#             venus symbol. The original character remains intact unless it
#             gets overwritten. Then an additional layer of noise with just
#             dots, that won't overwite an existing character. The noise
#             function is asymetric a bit, drifting to the lower right,
#             giving it some dynamism.
# 
#             The whole process reminds me of tweaking a Renderman shader
#             or something — fine tuning the constants to whatever looks
#             right.
# 
#             Now I see a crowd forming, perhaps at a march, joined up
#             together to form a Venus symbol, drifting in from the lower
#             right. I'm really happy with what I came up with,  and it's
#             entirely worth the effort. But women, in general, are, so
#             that's consistant.
