That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint.
The least little bit can do so much. All you have to do is let your imagination
go wild. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart.
Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do.
Everybody needs a friend.

Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a
snow-covered dinner. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. We'll put
some happy little leaves here and there. This is a fantastic little painting.
That easy. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke
Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green.

If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. You can get away
with a lot. You have to make these big decisions. I want everbody to be happy.
That's what it's all about. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing
your brush.

Just make a decision and let it go. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to
Washington. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. This is
truly an almighty mountain. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting
colder. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want -
and I can make this world as happy as I want it.

Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? If there's
two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. The
little tiny Tim easels will let you down. Don't forget to tell these special
people in your life just how special they are to you.

You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. If we're gonna walk though
the woods, we need a little path. It's amazing what you can do with a little
love in your heart.

We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. Now it's
beginning to make a little sense. Exercising the imagination, experimenting
with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to
your soul.

Use the resources to learn Perl 6 and write about your experience along the way!
Let us know when you do write something if you want to share it with the larger
Perl 6 community (you should!). Some writing topics could be programs you've
written, tricks you've learned, cool things about the Perl 6, etc. Because of
your fresh perspective as a learner, writing educational/training material would
be a great idea as well. If anything is Less Than Awesome in your experience you
can chat with us, or open an issue on the User Experience repository.

A simple way to do word wrapping is to use a greedy 
algorithm that puts as many words on a line as possible, 
then moving on to the next line to do the same until there 
are no more words left to place. This method is used by 
many modern word processors, such as OpenOffice.org Writer 
and Microsoft Word[citation needed]. This algorithm always 
uses the minimum possible number of lines but may lead to 
lines of widely varying lengths.

On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who
are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so
blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound
to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through
weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and
pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour,
when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being
able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain
avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the
obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be
repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in
these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure
other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
