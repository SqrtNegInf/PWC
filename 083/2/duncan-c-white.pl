# Task 2: "Flip Array
#
# You are given an array @A of positive numbers.
# 
# Write a script to flip the sign of some members of the given array so
# that the sum of the all members is minimum non-negative.
# 
# Given an array of positive elements, you have to flip the sign of some
# of its elements such that the resultant sum of the elements of array
# should be minimum non-negative(as close to zero as possible). Return
# the minimum no. of elements whose sign needs to be flipped such that
# the resultant sum is minimum non-negative.
# 
# Example 1:
# 	Input: @A = (3, 10, 8)
# 	Output: 1
# 
# Explanation:
# 
# Flipping the sign of just one element 10 gives the result 1 i.e. (3) +
# (-10) + (8) = 1
# 
# Example 2:
# 	Input: @A = (12, 2, 10)
# 	Output: 1
# 
# Explanation:
# 
# Flipping the sign of just one element 12 gives the result 0 i.e. (-12) +
# (2) + (10) = 0
# 
# My notes: clearly defined, but how to go about this one? several
# possible approaches.  brute force: each element may either be
# negated or not; try all combinations:-)  not very elegant, but does
# the job..
