#
#  DESCRIPTION: Flip the signs of some values of the array to get as
#               close as possible to 0 sum (but not negative).
#               Minimise for sum and then the number of sign flips.
#
# REQUIREMENTS: Params::Util, List::Util, Math::Combinatorics
#        NOTES: This is a bit brute-force; there is doubtless a neater
#               number-theory solution of which I am unaware.
