# TASK #2 - Ordered Letters
# Submitted by: E. Choroba
# Given a word, you can sort its letters alphabetically (case insensitive).
# For example, “beekeeper” becomes “beeeeekpr” and “dictionary” becomes
# “acdiinorty”.
#
# Write a script to find the longest English words that don’t change when
# their letters are sorted.
