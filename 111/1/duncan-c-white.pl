# Task 1: "Search Matrix
#
# You are given 5x5 matrix filled with integers such that each row is
# sorted from left to right and the first integer of each row is greater
# than the last integer of the previous row.
# 
# Write a script to find a given integer in the matrix using an efficient search algorithm.
# 
# Example
# 
#     Matrix: [  1,  2,  3,  5,  7 ]
#             [  9, 11, 15, 19, 20 ]
#             [ 23, 24, 25, 29, 31 ]
#             [ 32, 33, 39, 40, 42 ]
#             [ 45, 47, 48, 49, 50 ]
# 
#     Input: 35
#     Output: 0 since it is missing in the matrix
# 
#     Input: 39
#     Output: 1 as it exists in the matrix
# "
# 
# My notes: could flatten onto a 1D array and binary search.  Other
# methods?  Find which row it's in (if any) and then grep?  Did that.
# Not a very nice method (not even sure it works:-))
