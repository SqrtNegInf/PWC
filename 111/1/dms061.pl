# Question 1: You are given 5x5 matrix filled with integers such that
# each row is sorted from left to right and the first integer of each row
# is greater than the last integer of the previous row
# Write a script to find a given integer in the matrix using an efficient search algorithm

# Solution: 2d binary search. Elements are sorted, so binary search is a good algorithm to use
# 1st search for the array the element is in -- our "equality" check is an in range check X0 <= X <= Xn
# 2nd seach is standard binary search on the array the element is in
