#
# This challenge confuses me. We're basically asked to find a number
# in a sorted list. Which in languages without hashes one would solve
# with binary search (yielding an O (log N) solution), and in languages
# with hashes you'd use a hash (yielding an O (1) (expected) time solution).
# Sure, the hash takes linear preprocessing time, but since we're asked
# to write a script, we're spending linear time reading in the data
# anyway.
#
# Perhaps the intend was a subroutine which takes a matrix and a target
# number, but that was not what is being asked. The challenge explicitly
# asks for *a script*, which means we have to spend a linear amount of 
# time reading data anyway.
#
# Just to cover our bases, we'll do two implementation. Without arguments,
# we'll do that fast, hash bases, implementation. If the program is
# given the 'bsearch' argument, we will make use of a subroutine which
# takes a 2-d matrix and a target number as parameters, and which uses
# a bog standard binary search implementation to find out whether the
# target exists.
