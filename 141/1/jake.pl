### number attributes
# num specifies the lowest number to start analysis
# div_required specifies how many divisors we're aiming at
# output specifies how many numbers will be displayed
# all of these values can be adjusted as desired
# corner cases that won't comupte correctly: div_required = 0 and div_required = 1
# also odd div_required may run easily into deep recursion because seemingly they tend to be larger numbers
my $num_atr = {
    num => '1',
    div_required => '8',
    output_required => '10'
};

# output
my $res = collect_numbers();
say join (' ', @$res);

# aggregate required amount of numbers according to output_required
sub collect_numbers {
    my @result = ();

    while ( $#result+1 < $num_atr->{output_required} ) {

# starting at 1 we aggregate all divisors in an array
# we also aggregate all corresponding reciprocal values in another array
# these 2 lists contain all divisors: once ascending, once descending
# there's no need to check each number for modulo 0, we just need the first half of divisors
# we only need to find the middle of the lists before we have the entire list
# to do this we find the list element where both lists overlap, i.e. their symmetry axis
# if these arrays are symmetric to each other at the position of half our's div_required, we know they have the required amount of divisors
# example for even div_required = 8; num = 24; the divisor arrays are cross-symmetric at div_required / 2
# the axis is between $divisors[3] and $reciprocal[4]
#         <==||==>
# 24 12  8  6||4  3  2  1
#  1  2  3  4||6  8 12 24
#         <==||==>
#
# example for odd div_required = 9; num = 36; the divisor arrays are cross-symmetric at div_required / 2
# the axis is on $divisors[4] and $reciprocal[4]
#          <==|  |==>
# 36 18 12 09 |06| 04 03 02 01
# 01 02 03 04 |06| 09 12 18 36
