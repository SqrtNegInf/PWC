# Weekly Challenge 141 Task 2
#
# You are given positive integers, $m and $n.
#
# Write a script to find total count of integers created using the digits of 
# $m which is also divisible by $n.
#
# Repeating of digits are not allowed. Order/Sequence of digits canâ€™t be altered. 
# You are only allowed to use (n-1) digits at the most. For example, 432 is not 
# acceptable integer created using the digits of 1234. Also for 1234, you can only 
# have integers having no more than three digits.
