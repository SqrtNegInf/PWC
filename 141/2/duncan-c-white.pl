# TASK #2 - Like Numbers
# 
# You are given positive integers, $m and $n.  Write a script to find
# total count of integers created using the digits of $m which is also
# divisible by $n.
# 
# Repeating of digits are not allowed. Order/Sequence of digits can't
# be altered. You are only allowed to use (n-1) digits at the most. For
# example, 432 is not acceptable integer created using the digits of
# 1234 (because the digits are in the wrong order). Also for 1234, you can
# only have integers having no more than three digits.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 	Input: $m = 1234, $n = 2
# 	Output: 9
# 
# 	Possible integers created using the digits of 1234 are:
# 	1, 2, 3, 4, 12, 13, 14, 23, 24, 34, 123, 124, 134 and 234.
# 
# 	There are 9 integers divisible by 2 such as:
# 	2, 4, 12, 14, 24, 34, 124, 134 and 234.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 	Input: $m = 768, $n = 4
# 	Output: 3
# 
# 	Possible integers created using the digits of 768 are:
# 	7, 6, 8, 76, 78 and 68.
# 
# 	There are 3 integers divisible by 4 such as:
# 	8, 76 and 68.
# 
# 
# MY NOTES: Sounds pretty easy.  However, there's one mistake:
# "You are only allowed to use (n-1) digits at the most"
# is flatly contradicted by the examples.  I assume it meant
# "length(m)-1" which is what the examples show.
# 
# So each digit can either be present or absent - it's another "subsets"
# task.  One wrinkle: the length(m)-1 rule means that (all-present) is
# not a valid combination. Plus of course (all-absent) isn't either.
# 
# Last time we did a "subsets" task was in Challenge 136 Task 2,
# Fibonacci Seqence.  In that, I wrote:
# 
# "How do we sum subsets of values?  Two obvious ways:
# 
# 1. recursive function, iterating over the values: each value is either in the
#    subset or not, try both possibilities.
# 2. binary-counting method, iterate over every combination C from 1 ..
#    2**(number values)-1, then sum up only the elements where the corresponding
#    bit in C is on.
# "
# 
# That time, I wrote a (2) binary-counting method.  So this time round, let's
# try a recursive function instead, just for variety.
