#         FILE: 14102.pl
#
#        USAGE: ./14102.pl [ -v ] M N
#
#  DESCRIPTION: Give the count of numbers made from the digits of M in
#               order which are divisible by N
#
#      OPTIONS: -v gives verbose output
# REQUIREMENTS: Getopt::Long::Modern, Params::Util, List::MoreUtils
#         BUGS: Perhaps - see NOTES
#        NOTES: The spec is a bit loose with statements such as
#               "Repeating of digits are not allowed". Does this mean
#               input or output? I have taken it to mean just that an
#               input of 1234 will not allow 112 as a valid combo, which
#               seems reasonable. Similarly if 8888 is given as $m then
#               all the duplicated numbers are removed from the list (not
#               duplicated digits!) which should be just (8, 88, 888).
#
#               It also says "You are only allowed to use (n-1) digits
#               at the most" which I have taken to mean 1 fewer than the
#               total number of digits in $m. The use of "n" in that
#               statement is confusing but this seems to be the meaning
#               given the supplied examples.
