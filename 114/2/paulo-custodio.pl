# TASK #2 - Higher Integer Set Bits
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
# You are given a positive integer $N.
#
# Write a script to find the next higher integer having the same number of
# 1 bits in binary representation as $N.
#
# Example
# Input: $N = 3
# Output: 5
#
# Binary representation of $N is 011. There are two 1 bits. So the next higher
# integer is 5 having the same the number of 1 bits i.e. 101.
#
# Input: $N = 12
# Output: 17
#
# Binary representation of $N is 1100. There are two 1 bits. So the next higher
# integer is 17 having the same number of 1 bits i.e. 10001.
