#         Higher Integer Set Bits
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given a positive integer $N.
# 
#         Write a script to find the next higher integer having the same number
#         of 1 bits in binary representation as $N.
# 
#             Example
#             
#             Input: $N = 3
#             Output: 5
# 
#                 Binary representation of $N is 011. There are two 1 bits. So
#                 the next higher integer is 5 having the same the number of 1
#                 bits i.e. 101.
# 
#             Input: $N = 12
#             Output: 17
# 
#                 Binary representation of $N is 1100. There are two 1 bits. So
#                 the next higher integer is 17 having the same number of 1 bits
#                 i.e. 10001.
