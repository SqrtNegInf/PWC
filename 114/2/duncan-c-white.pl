# Task 2: "Higher Integer Set Bits
# 
# You are given a positive integer $N.
# 
# Write a script to find the next higher integer having the same number
# of 1 bits in binary representation as $N.
# 
# Example
# 
# Input: $N = 3
# Output: 5
# 
# Binary representation of 3 is 011. There are two 1 bits. So the next
# higher integer is 5 having the same the number of 1 bits i.e. 101.
# 
# Input: $N = 12
# Output: 17
# 
# Binary representation of 12 is 1100. There are two 1 bits. So the next
# higher integer is 17 having the same number of 1 bits i.e. 10001.
# "
# 
# My notes: also sounds pretty simple.  Generate and test for "having B
# bits set in the binary representation of numbers > N, where B==nbits(N)".
