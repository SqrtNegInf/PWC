#        USAGE: ./11402.pl [ N ]
#
#  DESCRIPTION: Output the next higher integer having the same number of
#               1 bits in binary representation as $N.
#
#      OPTIONS: If N is not supplied (or zero) then the test suite is
#               run instead
# REQUIREMENTS: Test::More for the test suite
#         BUGS: N is not checked to be a natural number. GIGO.
