# Task 1: "DNA Sequence
# 
# DNA is a long, chainlike molecule which has two strands twisted into
# a double helix. The two strands are made up of simpler molecules
# called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of the four
# nitrogen-containing nucleobases cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A)
# and thymine (T).
# 
# You are given DNA sequence, GTAAACCCCTTTTCATTTAGACAGATCGACTCCTTATCCATTCTCAGAGATGTGTTGCTGGTCGCCG.
# 
# Write a script to print nucleobase count in the given DNA sequence. Also
# print the complementary sequence where Thymine (T) on one strand is
# always facing an adenine (A) and vice versa; guanine (G) is always facing
# a cytosine (C) and vice versa.
# 
# To get the complementary sequence use the following mapping:
# 
# T => A
# A => T
# G => C
# C => G
# "
# 
# My notes: very clearly defined, simple to do.
