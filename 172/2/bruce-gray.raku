# I was surprised by my own internal wrestling over the API of five_indexes().
# Notice that no data from @x is actually used, only the .elems or .end of the array is needed.
# As much as my efficiency wanted to only pass in a UInt, I kept envisioning how
# easy it would be to call five_indexes() incorrectly,
# and settled on passing the whole array to be less error-prone.
# This seems like a silly quibble over the API of a sub used only in a self-contained single-author script.
