# TASK #2 > Fibonacci Sequence
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
# You are given a positive number $n.
#
# Write a script to find how many different sequences you can create using
# Fibonacci numbers where the sum of unique numbers in each sequence are the
# same as the given number.
#
# Fibonacci Numbers: 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89, ...
#
# Example 1
# Input:  $n = 16
# Output: 4
#
# Reason: There are 4 possible sequences that can be created using Fibonacci
# numbers
# i.e. (3 + 13), (1 + 2 + 13), (3 + 5 + 8) and (1 + 2 + 5 + 8).
# Example 2
# Input:  $n = 9
# Output: 2
#
# Reason: There are 2 possible sequences that can be created using Fibonacci
# numbers
# i.e. (1 + 3 + 5) and (1 + 8).
# Example 3
# Input:  $n = 15
# Output: 2
#
# Reason: There are 2 possible sequences that can be created using Fibonacci
# numbers
# i.e. (2 + 5 + 8) and (2 + 13).
