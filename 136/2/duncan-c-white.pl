# TASK #2 - Fibonacci Sequence
# 
# You are given a positive number $n.
# 
# Write a script to find how many different sequences you can create using
# Fibonacci numbers where the sum of unique numbers in each sequence are
# the same as the given number.
# 
#     Fibonacci Numbers: 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,..
# 
# Example 1
# 
#   Input:  $n = 16
#   Output: 4
# 
#   Reason: There are 4 possible sequences that can be created using Fibonacci numbers
#   i.e. (3 + 13), (1 + 2 + 13), (3 + 5 + 8) and (1 + 2 + 5 + 8).
# 
# Example 2
# 
#   Input:  $n = 9
#   Output: 2
# 
#   Reason: There are 2 possible sequences that can be created using Fibonacci numbers
#   i.e. (1 + 3 + 5) and (1 + 8).
# 
# Example 3
# 
#   Input:  $n = 15
#   Output: 2
# 
#   Reason: There are 2 possible sequences that can be created using Fibonacci numbers
#   i.e. (2 + 5 + 8) and (2 + 13).
# 
# MY NOTES: Pretty easy - find subsets of the first few Fibonacci numbers that sum to N.
# How many Fibonacci numbers should we consider?  Those <= N.
