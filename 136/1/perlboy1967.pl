TASK #1 â€º Two Friendly
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given 2 positive numbers, $m and $n.

Write a script to find out if the given two numbers are Two Friendly.

 ||   Two positive numbers, m and n are two friendly when gcd(m, n) = 2 ^ p where p > 0. 
 ||   The greatest common divisor (gcd) of a set of numbers is the largest positive number 
 ||   that divides all the numbers in the set without remainder.
