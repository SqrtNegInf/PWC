# TASK #1 - Two Friendly
# 
# You are given 2 positive numbers, $m and $n.
# 
# Write a script to find out if the given two numbers are Two Friendly.
# 
# Two positive numbers, m and n are two friendly when gcd(m, n) = 2 ^
# p where p > 0. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of a set of numbers
# is the largest positive number that divides all the numbers in the set
# without remainder.
# 
# Example 1
# 
#     Input: $m = 8, $n = 24
#     Output: 1
# 
#     Reason: gcd(8,24) = 8 => 2 ^ 3
# 
# Example 2
# 
#     Input: $m = 26, $n = 39
#     Output: 0
# 
#     Reason: gcd(26,39) = 13
# 
# Example 3
# 
#     Input: $m = 4, $n = 10
#     Output: 1
# 
#     Reason: gcd(4,10) = 2 => 2 ^ 1
# 
# MY NOTES: Pretty easy.  Euclid's GCD algorithm, then check if the result is a power of 2.
