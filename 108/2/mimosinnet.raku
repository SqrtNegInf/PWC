# I could not solve this challenge so I have looked at the other solutions.
# I have noticed that most of the solutions follow the Triangle scheme for calculations [1]
# except Aaron Smith [2].
#
# I have been rewriting Aaron Smith code to see if I could understand it! 
# Very impressive to see the translation of the Bell formula to Raku code!
# (specially when coming from social siences. Really nice!)
