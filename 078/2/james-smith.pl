  ## First parameter is an arrayref containing the values to be rotated
  ## Remaining parameters are the offsets for each rotation

  ## This is a great use of array slicing to achieve what we need
  ## Indexes go from offset -> size-1 & 0 -> offset-1
  ## Perl nicely handles the case where the value to the left of
  ## the double dot is higher than the value to the right

  print "  [@{[ @{$a}[ $_..(@{$a}-1), 0..($_-1) ] ]}]\n" foreach @_;

  ## Let us use the @{[ ]} trick to embed content into the print
  ## statement - this is a very useful and often under used feature
  ## of perl which makes for simpler code when rendering output...
  ## this is nice because print "@A" an print @A are subtly different
  ## with the "@A" putting spaces (default value of $")
