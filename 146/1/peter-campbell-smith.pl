# Write a script to generate the 10001st prime number.
	
# The sieve of Eratosthenes is a quick way to generate all the primes up to
# some maximum number.  However, that's not today's question.  This script
# therefore generates the sieve in 1000 blocks (ie 1-1000, then 1001 to 2000 
# and so on), counting the number of primes found in each block and stopping
# when that reaches or exceeds 10001.

# It takes less than 1 second to run on my machine. And to find the 1000001st
# prime takes only 28 seconds.  I haven't found a faster method.

# find primes in ranges of 1000, and count them until we get to (or past) $seeking
for ($from = 1; $prime_index <= $seeking; $from += 1000) {
	$to = $from + 999;

	# loop over all the possible factors, ie primes < sqrt($to)

		next if defined $not_a_prime[$factor];   # already known as not a prime
		
		# mark all the multiples of $factor as non-primes
		$start = int($from / $factor);           # multiples less than $start have already been done
		$start = 2 if $start < 2;
		for ($multiple = $start; $factor * $multiple <= $to; $multiple ++) {
			$not_a_prime[$factor * $multiple] = 1;
