# You are given a fraction, a member of the curious fraction tree (CFT).
# Write a script to find out the parent and grandparent of the given member.

# The left child of parent a/b in the CFT is a/(a+b) and the right
# child is (a+b)/b.  If a member is < 1 then it is a left child
# of its parent, if > 1 then a right child.

# So given a member a/b ...
