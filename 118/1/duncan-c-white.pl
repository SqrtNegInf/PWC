# Task 1: "Binary Palindrome
# 
# You are given a positive integer $N.
# 
# Write a script to find out if the binary representation of the given
# integer is Palindrome. Print 1 if it is otherwise 0.
# 
# Example
# 
#   Input: $N = 5
#   Output: 1 as binary representation of 5 is 101 which is Palindrome.
# 
#   Input: $N = 4
#   Output: 0 as binary representation of 4 is 100 which is NOT Palindrome.
# "
# 
# My notes: seems pretty easy.
