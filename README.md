## PWC (beta)

The purpose of this repository is to collect Raku and Perl code from the Perl Weekly Challenge site
to make it easy to compare them, verify they work, etc.

To Be Very Clear: None of the code is mine (I have never submitted anything to the PWC). I am
merely taking a slice of what's there for examination and testing.

The layout is different from the PWC site, with each challenge just directories '1' and '2' for all the tasks
and the solutions bearing the *names* of the authors (or their handles anyway). 
All mentions of 'Perl6' are converted to 'Raku', likewise
'Perl5' is change to just 'Perl'. File extensions are '.raku' and '.pl' (and '.pm', if the authors used them).
