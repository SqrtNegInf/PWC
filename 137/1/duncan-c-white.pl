# TASK #1 - Long Year
# 
# Write a script to find all the years between 1900 and 2100 which is a Long Year.
# 
#     A year is Long if it has 53 weeks.
# 
# For more information about Long Year, please refer to
# 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date#Weeks_per_year
# 
# Expected Output
# 
# 1903, 1908, 1914, 1920, 1925,
# 1931, 1936, 1942, 1948, 1953,
# 1959, 1964, 1970, 1976, 1981,
# 1987, 1992, 1998, 2004, 2009,
# 2015, 2020, 2026, 2032, 2037,
# 2043, 2048, 2054, 2060, 2065,
# 2071, 2076, 2082, 2088, 2093,
# 2099
# 
# MY NOTES: Pretty easy.  Especially using the p(year) and weeks(year) functions given,
# won't even need a date manipulation module..
