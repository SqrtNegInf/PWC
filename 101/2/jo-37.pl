### Input and Output

say inner_origin(pairs @ARGV);


### Implementation

# Check if the origin [0, 0] is inside a given polygon or on its
# border.  The polygon is specified by the coordinates of its corners
# and may be degenerated: Corners may be located on a common line
# and need not be distinct.
# Two consecutive checks are performed:
# 1) Origin orientation:
#    For each edge of the polygon (as a cycle), the coordinates of
#    its corners form a 2x2 matrix.  The sign of the corresponding
#    determinant signals if the origin is left or right of the
#    (directed) edge. If the origin is an inner point, all orientations
#    must agree, whereas an outer point will show different signs.
# 2) Axis projection:
#    If the given points are collinear, all determinants are zero
#    and cannot be used as an indicator for "inner" and "outer".  In
#    that case the projection of the points onto the x and y axes reveal
#    the location of the origin inside or outside of the line segment.
#
# Note: After I finished the task for triangles, it appeared that a
# small change would extend the solution to polygons.  So here it is.

    # all points.
    my $indx = append sequence(indx, 1, $p->dim(0)),
        zeroes(indx, 1, $p->dim(0));

    # Get the minimum and the maximum of the matrices' determinants
    # formed by the point pairs.

    # If determinants have different signs, the origin is outside the
    # polygon.
    return 0 if $min_d < 0 && $max_d > 0;

    # If there is at least one nonzero determinant and there are no
    # differing signs, the origin is located inside the polygon (or on
    # its border).
    return 1 if $min_d >= 0 && $max_d > 0 || $min_d < 0 && $max_d <= 0;
