# Task 1: "Pack a Spiral
# Submitted by: Stuart Little
# 
# You are given an array @A of items (integers say, but they can be anything).
# 
# Your task is to pack that array into an MxN matrix spirally
# counterclockwise, as tightly as possible.
# 
# 'Tightly' means the absolute value |M-N| of the difference has to be as
# small as possible.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 	Input: @A = (1,2,3,4)
# 
# 	Output:
# 
# 	    4 3
# 	    1 2
# 
# Since the given array is already a 1x4 matrix on its own, but that's
# not as tight as possible. Instead, you'd spiral it counterclockwise into
# 
#     4 3
#     1 2
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 	Input: @A = (1..6)
# 
# 	Output:
# 
# 	    6 5 4
# 	    1 2 3
# 
# 	or
# 
# 	    5 4
# 	    6 3
# 	    1 2
# 
# 	Either will do as an answer, because they're equally tight.
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 	Input: @A = (1..12)
# 
# 	Output:
# 
# 	       9  8  7 6
# 	      10 11 12 5
# 	       1  2  3 4
# 
# 	or
# 
# 	       8  7 6
# 	       9 12 5
# 	      10 11 4
# 	       1  2 3

# 
# My notes: ok, interesting question.  First, need to find "tightest" MxN
# where abs(M-N) is minimum, easy.  Second, need to build MxN array via
# a "counterclockwise spiral starting at bottom corner".  Not trivial, but
# should be relatively easy.   Hmmm.. actually, I can't see a particularly
# quick and easy way, I'm sure I'm missing something.
