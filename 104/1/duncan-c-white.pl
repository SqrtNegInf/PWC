# Task 1: "FUSC Sequence
# 
# Write a script to generate first 50 members of FUSC Sequence. Please
# refer to http://oeis.org/A002487 for more information.
# 
# The sequence defined as below:
# 
# 	fusc(0) = 0
# 	fusc(1) = 1
# 
# for n > 1:
# 	when n is even: fusc(n) = fusc(n / 2),
# 	when n is odd: fusc(n) = fusc((n-1)/2) + fusc((n+1)/2)
# "
# 
# My notes: looks like a case for Memoize to make this highly recursive
# function efficient.  No, turns out it's quite efficient, so we don't
# even need Memoize!
