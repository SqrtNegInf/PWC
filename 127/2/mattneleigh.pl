# Find overlaps between numerical intervals in a list and previous (but not
# subsequent) intervals within that list
# Takes one argument:
# * A list of refs to intervals- arrays containing two numerical values, which
#   must appear in ascending order (e.g. [1, 5] but not [7, 3])
# Returns:
# * A list of refs to arrays containing the indices of overlapping intervals
#   found earlier in the original interval list; the position of each array in
#   this list corresponds to the position of the member of the argument list
#   that was being checked for previous overlaps.  If no overlaps were found
#   for that interval, the corresponding array in the returned list will be
#   empty.  As there are no previous arguments to check for the first interval,
#   the first returned array will always be empty.
#
# Example:
#   @intervals = ( [3, 5], [7, 10], [6, 8], [4, 9] );
#   @overlaps = find_previous_overlaps(@intervals);
#   # @overlaps contains:
#   # ( [], [], [ 1 ], [ 0, 1, 2 ] )
