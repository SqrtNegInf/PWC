# Determine if two sets are disjoint, or if not, which members they have in
# common; this will work for any two sets of scalar values that can be used as
# hash keys, but note that string matching will be case-sensitive

# * A ref to an array whose values form the members of Set 1
# * A ref to an array whose values form the members of Set 2
# Returns:
# * A list of values common to the two sets, in the order in which they appear
#   in Set 2; if this list is empty, the sets are disjoint (no common members)
