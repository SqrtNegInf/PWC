=head1 NAME

TWC 127, TASK #1 : Disjoint Sets

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  ch-1.pl [options] set1_string set2_string

  Description:    Given two sets of integers, say if they are disjoint.

  Options:
    --help        Brief help
    --task        Full description
    --test        Run embedded test

  Arguments:
    
    Two strings, each defining a set. The list of elements of the set are integers and can be either comma or whitespace delimited. There can be an optional containing set of brackets.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<L<The Weekly Challenge, TASK #1 E<gt> Disjoint Sets|https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-127/#TASK1>>

I<Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar>

You are given two sets with unique integers.

Write a script to figure out if they are disjoint.

  The two sets are disjoint if they don't have any common members.


=head2 Example

  Input: @S1 = (1, 2, 5, 3, 4)
         @S2 = (4, 6, 7, 8, 9)
  Output: 0 as the given two sets have common member 4.

  Input: @S1 = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
         @S2 = (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
  Output: 1 as the given two sets do not have common member.
  

=head1 INTERPRETATION

No check is made for the assertion that an input set consists of unique integers, since that has no bearing on whether the two sets are disjoint.

Checks for the containing brackets are not strict. No effort is made to enforce that they are balanced or matched, since they are just there as a convenience for people who may be cutting-and-pasting the input from the problem statement.
