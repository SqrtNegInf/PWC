# TASK #2 - Rob The House
# 
# You are planning to rob a row of houses, always starting with the first
# and moving in the same direction. However, you can't rob two adjacent
# houses.
# 
# Write a script to find the highest possible gain that can be achieved.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
#   Input: @valuables = (2, 4, 5);
#   Output: 7
# 
# If we rob house 0 we get 2 and then the only house we can rob is house
# 2 where we have 5.  So the total valuables in this case is (2 + 5) = 7.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
#   Input: @valuables = (4, 2, 3, 6, 5, 3);
#   Output: 13
# 
# The best choice would be to first rob house 0 then rob house 3
# then finally house 5.  This would give us 4 + 6 + 3 =13.
# 
# MY NOTES: Hmm.. some sort of recursive "find all paths" method.
# It always helps to pick the right function purpose and name.
# I think the recursive function we need is: 
# my $maxvaluables = maxrobbery( startpos ), invoked as
# my $max=maxrobbery(0)?
#
# Extra note: if you want to which the house numbers and corresponding
# valuables that make up the maximum robbery, run this with the -d flag.
