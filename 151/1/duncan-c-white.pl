# TASK #1 - Binary Tree Depth
# 
# You are given binary tree.
# 
# Write a script to find the minimum depth.
# 
# The minimum depth is the number of nodes from the root to the nearest
# leaf node (node without any children).
# 
# Example 1:
# 
#   Input: '1 | 2 3 | 4 5'
# 
#                 1
#                / \
#               2   3
#              / \
#             4   5
# 
#   Output: 2
# 
# Example 2:
# 
#   Input: '1 | 2 3 | 4 *  * 5 | * 6'
# 
#                 1
#                / \
#               2   3
#              /     \
#             4       5
#              \
#               6
#   Output: 3
# 
# MY NOTES: well, if I built a binary tree from the input, it would be quite
# simple to find the minimum depth.  But there must be a way to solve the
# problem using only the input syntax.  Something like: split into rows on '|'.
# Each row should have 2 * (rowno-1) elements (starting at row 1).  If a row hasn't
# got that many elements, pad it with '*'s.  Now, find the first non-full row,
# ie. with one or more '*'s.  Take the row a pair of elements at a time. If
# any pair are both '*'s, then the min depth is rowno-1.  Otherwise proceed
# to the next row, and keep going down the rows.
