# You are given binary tree. Write a script to find the minimum depth.
# The minimum depth is the number of nodes from the root to the nearest leaf node 
# (node without any children).

# Note: this assumes that all occupied nodes contain a single character.  if that
# were not the case, the same algorithm would work using an array rather than
# a string to represent the contents of each level.
