# TASK #1 - Pythagorean Means
# 
# You are given a set of integers.
# 
# Write a script to compute all three Pythagorean Means i.e Arithmetic Mean,
# Geometric Mean and Harmonic Mean of the given set of integers. Please
# refer to wikipedia page for more informations.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 	Input: @n = (1,3,5,6,9)
# 	Output: AM = 4.8, GM = 3.9, HM = 2.8
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 	Input: @n = (2,4,6,8,10)
# 	Output: AM = 6.0, GM = 5.2, HM = 4.4
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 	Input: @n = (1,2,3,4,5)
# 	Output: AM = 3.0, GM = 2.6, HM = 2.2
# 
# MY NOTES: ok.  Pretty easy, although the geometric mean involves
# calculating the product of the numbers, which may get pretty huge.
# Tried bigrat, but it broke the nth-root calculation using **.
