# TASK #2 › Brazilian Number
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
# You are given a number $n > 3.
#
# Write a script to find out if the given number is a Brazilian Number.
#
# A positive integer number N has at least one natural number B where
# 1 < B < N-1 where the representation of N in base B has same digits.
#
#
# Example 1:
# Input: $n = 7
# Output: 1
#
# Since 7 in base 2 is 111.
# Example 2:
# Input: $n = 6
# Output: 0
#
# Since 6 in base 2 is 110,
#       6 in base 3 is 20 and
#       6 in base 4 is 12.
# Example 3:
# Input: $n = 8
# Output: 1
#
# Since 8 in base 3 is 22.
