# TASK #2 - Ulam Sequence
# 
# You are given two positive numbers, $u and $v.
# 
# Write a script to generate Ulam Sequence having at least 10 Ulam numbers
# where $u and $v are the first 2 Ulam numbers.
# 
# For more information about Ulam Sequence, please checkout the website
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_number
# 
# The standard Ulam sequence (the (1, 2)-Ulam sequence) starts with U1 =
# 1 and U2 = 2. Then for n > 2, Un is defined to be the smallest integer
# that is the sum of two distinct earlier terms in exactly one way and
# larger than all earlier terms.
# 
# Example 1
# 
# 	Input: $u = 1, $v = 2
# 	Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18
# 
# Example 2
# 
# 	Input: $u = 2, $v = 3
# 	Output: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 18, 19
# 
# Example 3
# 
# 	Input: $u = 2, $v = 5
# 	Output: 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 19, 23
# 
# 
# MY NOTES: hmm..  sounds relatively straightforward.  I'm slightly puzzled
# by "in exactly one way", but an article linked from the Wikipedia page
# gives the clearer definition:
#
# Un+1 is the smallest integer > Un that can be written Uj+Uk for exactly
# one pair (j,k) where 1<=j<k<=n.
#
# The "exactly one pair" suggests to me a frequency hash of pair-sums.
# So I propose:
# - we check each distinct pair of earlier terms Uj, Uk,
# - building a frequency hash of all $freq{Uj+Uk > Un} we find.
# Then pick all keys of %freq whose frequency is 1.
# Then pick the smallest.
#
