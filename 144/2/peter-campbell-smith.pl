# You are given two positive numbers, $u and $v.
# Write a script to generate Ulam Sequence having at least 10 Ulam numbers where $u and $v are the first 2 Ulam numbers.
# The first two numbers in an Ulam sequence are the lesser (U1) and the greater (U2) of $u and $v.
# Then for n > 2, Un is defined to be the smallest integer that is the sum of two distinct earlier terms in exactly one 
# way, and larger than all earlier terms.
