TASK #2 â€º Ulam Sequence
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given two positive numbers, $u and $v.

Write a script to generate Ulam Sequence having at least 10 Ulam numbers
where $u and $v are the first 2 Ulam numbers.

For more information about Ulam Sequence, please checkout the website.

|| The standard Ulam sequence (the (1, 2)-Ulam sequence) starts with U1 = 1 
|| and U2 = 2. Then for n > 2, Un is defined to be the smallest integer that
|| is the sum of two distinct earlier terms in exactly one way and larger 
|| than all earlier terms.
