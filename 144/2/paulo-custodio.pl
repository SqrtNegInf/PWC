# TASK #2 > Ulam Sequence
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
# You are given two positive numbers, $u and $v.
#
# Write a script to generate Ulam Sequence having at least 10 Ulam numbers
# where $u and $v are the first 2 Ulam numbers.
#
# For more information about Ulam Sequence, please checkout the website.
#
# The standard Ulam sequence (the (1, 2)-Ulam sequence) starts with U1 = 1 and
# U2 = 2. Then for n > 2, Un is defined to be the smallest integer that is the
# sum of two distinct earlier terms in exactly one way and larger than all
# earlier terms.
