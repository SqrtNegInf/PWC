Assumptions
-----------
All dates are interpreted according to the Gregorian calendar [2,3]. Dates
prior to 15th October, 1582, when the Gregorian calendar was first introduced,
are calculated according to the "proleptic Gregorian calendar" [3] which
extends backwards to dates before the calendar was in use. However, dates prior
to the year 1 AD are not supported.

Solution
--------
The solution uses Raku's native Date class [1]. Its constructor accepts a "*"
as the argument to its "day" parameter: this gives the last day in the month,
automatically finding the last day of February as 28 or 29, according to
whether or not the year is a leap year.

Then, Date's day-of-week() method finds the weekday of the last day in the
month: it "[r]eturns the day of the week, where 1 is Monday, 2 is Tuesday and
Sunday is 7." [1] If the last day is a Monday, then the last Sunday is one day
prior; if a Tuesday, it is two days prior; and so on. Hence, the date of the
last Sunday is calculated by subtracting from the date of the last day the
weekday of the last day modulo 7.
