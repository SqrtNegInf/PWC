    TASK #1 â€º Average of Stream
    Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
    You are given a stream of numbers, @N.

    Write a script to print the average of the stream at every point.

    Example
    Input: @N = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, ...)
    Output:      10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, ...

    Average of first number is 10.
    Average of first 2 numbers (10+20)/2 = 15
    Average of first 3 numbers (10+20+30)/3 = 20
    Average of first 4 numbers (10+20+30+40)/4 = 25 and so on.
