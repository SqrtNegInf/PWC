# Perl Weekly Challenge 102, Task #1, Rare Numbers
#
# You are given a positive integer $N.
# Write a script to generate all Rare numbers of size $N if exists.
# http://www.shyamsundergupta.com/rare.htm
# The web site lists several constraints that can be used to limit the search.
# Also discussed at https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Talk:Rare_numbers
# Examples
# (a) 2 digits: 65
# (b) 6 digits: 621770
# (c) 9 digits: 281089082
#
# From the reference web site:
# The numbers, which gives a perfect square on adding as well as subtracting
# its reverse are rare and hence termed as Rare Numbers.
# 
# If R is a positive integer and R1 is the integer obtained from R by writing
# its decimal digits in reverse order, then if R + R1 and R - R1 both are
# perfect square then R is termed as Rare Number.
# 
# So for R to be a Rare Number we must have
# R + R1 = X^2 and R - R1 = Y^2
# 
# For example: For R=65, R1=56
# R+R1 = 65+56 = 121 = 11^2   AND    R-R1 = 65 - 56 = 9 = 3^2
