#       TASK #2 â€º Trapped Rain Water
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given an array of positive numbers @N.
# 
#         Write a script to represent it as Histogram Chart and find out how
#         much water it can trap.
# 
#         Example 1:
#         Input: @N = (2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 5)
#         The histogram representation of the given array is as below.
#              5           #
#              4     #     #
#              3     #     #
#              2 #   #   # #
#              1 # # # # # #
#              _ _ _ _ _ _ _
#                2 1 4 1 2 5
#         Looking at the above histogram, we can see, it can trap 1 unit of rain
#         water between 1st and 3rd column. Similary it can trap 5 units of rain
#         water betweem 3rd and last column.
# 
#         Therefore your script should print 6.
# 
#         Example 2:
#         Input: @N = (3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5)
#         The histogram representation of the given array is as below.
#              5           #
#              4           #
#              3 #   #     #
#              2 #   #     #
#              1 # # # # # #
#              _ _ _ _ _ _ _
#                3 1 3 1 1 5
#         Looking at the above histogram, we can see, it can trap 2 units of
#         rain water between 1st and 3rd column. Also it can trap 4 units of
#         rain water between 3rd and last column.
# 
#         Therefore your script should print 6.
