You are given a string of delimiter pairs and a string to search.Write a script to return two strings, the first with any characters matching the “opening character” set, the second with any matching the “closing character” set.

Example 1:

Input:
    Delimiter pairs: ""[]()
    Search String: "I like (parens) and the Apple ][+" they said.

Output:
    "(["
    ")]"

Example 2:

Input:
    Delimiter pairs: **//<>
    Search String: /* This is a comment (in some languages) */ <could be a tag>
Output:
    /**/<
    /**/>

# The problem is probably to call a string function with a string that can 
# contain delimiters itself. A possible solution: to have a delimiter at 
# the quote-like operator that would not occur in the string.
# Here, the delimiter in the function call is \N{CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER HARD SIGN},
# which is highly unlikely to occur in the following text. :-)
