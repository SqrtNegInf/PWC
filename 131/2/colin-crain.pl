#       Find Pairs
#         Submitted by: Yary
#         You are given a string of delimiter pairs and a string to search.
# 
#         Write a script to return two strings, the first with any
#         characters matching the “opening character” set, the second with
#         any matching the “closing character” set.
# 
#         Example 1:
#             Input:
#                 Delimiter pairs: ""[]()
#                 Search String: 
#                     "I like (parens) and the Apple ][+" they said.
#     
#             Output:
#                 "(["
#                 ")]"
#         Example 2:
#             Input:
#                 Delimiter pairs: **//<>
#                 Search String: 
#                     /* This is a comment (in some languages) */ <could be a tag>
#     
#             Output:
#                 /**/<
#                 /**/>

#             method:
#                 the harder you look the messier this problem gets. Nested delimiters get 
#                 particularly so. Some assumptions:
#                     1. with matching delimiters, the second occurance should 
#                         close the first.
#                     2. a closing delimiter cannot be the opener for a different pair.
#                     3. a delimiter is only one character. Example 2 breaks the common 
#                         comment pair /* into two individual delimiters. 
#                     4. should we acknowledge a close without an open before it? Hmmm...
#                     
#                 Oh but wait, that's not the problem. The problem wants a filtered 
#                 list of characters from the open set and the same from the closed. That's 
#                 it. No counting openings and closings — none of that. We'll break it into 
#                 an array of chars and use grep, then rejoin. Easy-peasy.
