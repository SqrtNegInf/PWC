# Task 1: "Number Sequence
# 
# You are given a number $N >= 10.
# 
# Write a script to split the given number such that the difference between
# two consecutive numbers is always 1 and it shouldn't have leading 0.
# 
# Print the given number if it impossible to split the number.
# 
# Example
# 
#   Input: $N = 1234
#   Output: 1,2,3,4
# 
#   Input: $N = 91011
#   Output: 9,10,11
# 
#   Input: $N = 10203
#   Output: 10203 as it is impossible to split satisfying the conditions.
# "
# 
# My notes: seems pretty easy.  Only question is the initial number's width - try all possible widths.
