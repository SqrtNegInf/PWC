# Task 2: "Sequence without 1-on-1
# 
# Write a script to generate sequence starting at 1. Consider the increasing
# sequence of integers which contain only 1's, 2's and 3's, and
# do not have any doublets of 1's like below. Please accept a positive
# integer $N and print the $Nth term in the generated sequence.
# 
#     1, 2, 3, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 31, 32, 33, 121, 122, 123, 131, ...
# 
# Example
# 
#   Input: $N = 5
#   Output: 13
# 
#   Input: $N = 10
#   Output: 32
# 
#   Input: $N = 60
#   Output: 2223

# 
# My notes: hmm, depends on what we mean by "doublet", as in "no doublets of 1".
# I'm choosing to assume that it means "no two sequential 1s".  should be
# pretty easy - let's do it by generate and test.
