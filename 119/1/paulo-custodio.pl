#
# TASK #1 - Swap Nibbles
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
# You are given a positive integer $N.
#
# Write a script to swap the two nibbles of the binary representation of the
# given number and print the decimal number of the new binary representation.
#
# A nibble is a four-bit aggregation, or half an octet.
#
# To keep the task simple, we only allow integer less than or equal to 255.
#
# Example
# Input: $N = 101
# Output: 86
#
# Binary representation of decimal 101 is 1100101 or as 2 nibbles (0110)(0101).
# The swapped nibbles would be (0101)(0110) same as decimal 86.
#
# Input: $N = 18
# Output: 33
#
# Binary representation of decimal 18 is 10010 or as 2 nibbles (0001)(0010).
# The swapped nibbles would be (0010)(0001) same as decimal 33.

use Modern::Perl;
my $N = shift // 101;
say ((($N >> 4) & 0x0f) | (($N << 4) & 0xf0));
