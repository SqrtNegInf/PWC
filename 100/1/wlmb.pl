    Converts time between 12 and 24 hour formats

       Each argument must have the format "hh:mm:ss ampm"
       where the minutes and seconds are optional and
       ampm is either am or pm or null.
       If ampm is given, the hour should be not greater than 12 nor
       smaller than 1. If not, hour should be smaller than 24.
       Minutes and seconds should be smaller than 60.
