# Task 2: "Jump Game
# 
# You are given an array of positive numbers @N, where value at each index
# determines how far you are allowed to jump further.  Write a script to
# decide if you can jump to the last index. Print 1 if you are able to
# reach the last index otherwise 0.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 	Input: @N = (1, 2, 1, 2)
#	Output: 1
# 
# as we jump one place from index 0 and then twoe places from index 1 to
# reach the last index.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 	Input: @N = (2,1,1,0,2)
# 	Output: 0
# 
# it is impossible to reach the last index. as we jump two places from index
# 0 to reach index 2, followed by one place jump from index 2 to reach the
# index 3. once you reached the index 3, you can't go any further because
# you can only jump 0 position further.
# "
# 
# My notes: does it mean "decide if you can jump to the last index, starting at index 0"?
# all the examples show that, so I'm going to assume that's what it means.  But it
# doesn't say that explicitly - reading at first I thought you would have a
# free choice of where to start, so would have to search "starting at pos 0",
# "starting at pos 1"... etc.  Negative numbers would also make it more interesting.
