### Input and Output

say minsum([map [split /[ ,] */], @ARGV]);


### Implementation

# The triangular data shape might be a red herring suggesting to find
# some kind of path through the triangle.  However, from the examples I
# conclude it's just going through the whole array via any field in each
# row.  Thus the data's shape is completely irrelevant and is ignored
# here.

# Find the minumum sum picking one element from each row of an AoA.
sub minsum {
    vecsum map vecmin(@$_), @{+shift}
}

        is minsum([[5], [2,3], [4,1,5], [0,1,2,3], [7,2,4,1,9]]), 9,
            'example 2';
