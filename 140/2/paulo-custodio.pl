# TASK #2 > Multiplication Table
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
# You are given 3 positive integers, $i, $j and $k.
#
# Write a script to print the $kth element in the sorted multiplication table of $i and $j.
#
# Example 1
# Input: $i = 2; $j = 3; $k = 4
# Output: 3
#
# Since the multiplication of 2 x 3 is as below:
#
#     1 2 3
#     2 4 6
#
# The sorted multiplication table:
#
#     1 2 2 3 4 6
#
# Now the 4th element in the table is "3".
# Example 2
# Input: $i = 3; $j = 3; $k = 6
# Output: 4
#
# Since the multiplication of 3 x 3 is as below:
#
#     1 2 3
#     2 4 6
#     3 6 9
#
# The sorted multiplication table:
#
#     1 2 2 3 3 4 6 6 9
#
# Now the 6th element in the table is "4".
