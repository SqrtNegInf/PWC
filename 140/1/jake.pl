# convert decimals to binaries

# each n-th power of 2 in decimal translates to the n-th power of 10 in binary:
# n=0: 1>1 | n=1: 2>10 | n=2: 4>100 and so on, we know the drill.
# For conversion, we first determine the largest power contained in the decimal number.
# Next, we subtract this power from our decimal and determine the largest power in this 'remainder'.
# This is repeated until there is no remainder left.
# For each n-th power of 2 we add a binary quantum to an accumulator.
# At the end of our 'run for power' this accumulator is our binary equivalent to our decimal.

    # we then take the remainder (what comes on top of the current power to 2) and investigate its powers.
    # p.e. our decimal is 9.

# Once we reach the beginning of our binary, we will have accumulated our decimal.
