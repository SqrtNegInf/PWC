'144/1/roger-bell-west.raku' had a run-time error (immutable variable), 2nd buggy bit of Raku uncovered.

JVM will change far less frequently than MoarVM (and is a dog-slow pain to boot), 
and Perl changes even less often, so typical test run will be just for MoarVM.

Global check for MoarVM/JVM differences:
find . -name '00-raku-moar.txt' -print -execdir diff ./00-raku-moar.txt ./00-raku-jvm.txt \;

Deal with trivial changes between runs (timings, randomness, hash order)
One particular fix often needed in e-choroba's code: 
    use Test2::V0 -srand => 1234;

'pentagonal' tasks are slow in Raku (both backends)

That didn't take long: discovered/fixed a problem with JVM (character 'â…“' in 148/2/bruce-gray.raku)
Currently not handling Raku libraries ('.rakumod', 1st case in challenge 130)
At some point also have to deal with 'pm6' (far future, only in challenges <= 87)

Expanding testing to Perl, basic functions now complete.
Piggy-backing on ecosystem RC modules via symbolic link

Expanding testing to JVM.  
Found a task in weekly #149 that was unreasonably slow in current JVM (crashed in previous)

Repository public.
Surely recent Raku submissions will mostly be fine, but as I work backwards...

Getting traction on this finally.  Utilities in Raku this time.
