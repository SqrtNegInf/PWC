'PWC-rerun' is clean, 085-156. (fixed the exception noted below)

2022-03-24
Rarely, some Perl task in 125/1 varies. Not able to figure out which...

2022-03-20
'093/1/mimosinnet.raku' reveals a JVM bug.

2022-03-19
Mostly the Raku code does not explore the wild hinterlands, not a surprise I guess.

2022-03-14
Added Bruce Gray code from 150, 155 that never showed up on PWC site. (p.s. all showed up, some very late)

2022-03-13
Oops, jumped the gun on 155, more commits from PWC keep arriving; wait until weekday from now on.

2022-03-12
Getting more efficient, but maybe time for a pause and some operator analysis.

2022-03-10
With ~1/3rd done, current timing of 18m suggests full Perl+MoarVM re-run will take about an hour, which is very reasonable.

2022-03-09
Tried including JVM in the 're-run' testing, more clean-up (but not in general, too slow)
Most of the JVM code failures have to do with 'gather'.

2022-03-08
Now including Perl in the 're-run' testing, fair bit of clean-up required for that.

2022-03-07
Rather anti-social for a solution to use a module that pulls in Moose, and huge # of supporting tools (114/1/christian-jaeger.pl)

2022-03-03
Some cleanup today: PWC-rerun, as intended, helping find task output that varies.
To fix: '.rakumod' files (in particular Arne Sommer's) get sync'd as 'raku.pl'

2022-02-28
Over half the tasks in 132/1 deleted, based on current-date, which doesn't test well.

2022-02-26
So many duplicative Perl tasks, just dropping any that give me trouble.

2022-02-16
Make sure the 00*err files show the reason a program was disabled, to ease follow-up.

2022-02-14
On hold, while try to get JVM working again (switch to rakubrew)

2022-02-12
Done 10 weeks, look back and see whether any of the 'extras' some authors provide are worth considering.
Low-hanging fruit: easy to get all the blog links.
In the future: 't' directories and/or .t files.

2022-02-11
Start handling '.rakumod'

2022-02-10
'144/1/roger-bell-west.raku' had a run-time error (immutable variable), 2nd buggy bit of Raku uncovered.

2022-02-09
JVM will change far less frequently than MoarVM (and is a dog-slow pain to boot), 
and Perl changes even less often, so typical test run will be just for MoarVM.

2022-02-08
Global check for MoarVM/JVM differences:
find . -name '00-raku-moar.txt' -print -execdir diff ./00-raku-moar.txt ./00-raku-jvm.txt \;

2022-02-07
Deal with trivial changes between runs (timings, randomness, hash order)
One particular fix often needed in e-choroba's code: 
    use Test2::V0 -srand => 1234;

2022-02-05
'pentagonal' tasks are slow in Raku (both backends)

2022-02-04
That didn't take long: discovered/fixed a problem with JVM (character 'â…“' in 148/2/bruce-gray.raku)
Currently not handling Raku libraries ('.rakumod', 1st case in challenge 140)
At some point also have to deal with 'pm6' (far future, only in challenges <= 87)

2022-02-03
Expanding testing to Perl, basic functions now complete.
Piggy-backing on ecosystem RC modules via symbolic link 

2022-02-02
Expanding testing to JVM.  
Found a task in weekly #149 that was unreasonably slow in current JVM (crashed in previous)

2022-02-01
Repository public.
Surely recent Raku submissions will mostly be fine, but as I work backwards...

2022-01-31
Getting traction on this finally.  Utilities in Raku this time.
